## Effective Copilot Prompts Library

### Data Processing Prompts
```
1. **Data Loading Prompt:**
"Create a robust Python class to load and validate CSV files with error handling. The class should handle missing values, data type conversion, and provide summary statistics. Include methods for WHR2024.csv (happiness data) and EdibleFoods-1961-2011.csv (nutrition data)."

2. **API Integration Prompt:**
"Build a Python module to fetch data from Statistics Finland PxWeb API. Include rate limiting, caching, error handling, and data transformation to pandas DataFrame. Focus on GDP, unemployment, and education statistics."

3. **Data Cleaning Prompt:**
"Create comprehensive data cleaning functions for happiness and food consumption datasets. Handle outliers, normalize column names, ensure consistent country naming, and create country mapping between datasets."
```

### Analysis Prompts
```
4. **Correlation Analysis Prompt:**
"Implement statistical correlation analysis between happiness scores and various factors. Include Pearson and Spearman correlations, significance testing, and automated interpretation of results. Generate insights about Finland specifically."

5. **Comparative Analysis Prompt:**
"Create functions to compare Finland against Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland) across multiple dimensions. Include ranking systems, percentage differences, and trend analysis over time."

6. **Hypothesis Generation Prompt:**
"Develop an automated hypothesis generation system that analyzes correlations and creates data-driven hypotheses about Finnish happiness factors. Include confidence levels and supporting evidence."
```

### Visualization Prompts
```
7. **Interactive Dashboard Prompt:**
"Create an interactive Streamlit dashboard for happiness factor analysis. Include correlation heatmaps, time series plots, country comparisons, and filter controls. Make Finland prominently highlighted in all visualizations."

8. **Chart Creation Prompt:**
"Build a comprehensive visualization library using plotly/matplotlib for happiness data analysis. Include functions for correlation plots, bar charts, time series, and geographic visualizations with consistent styling."

9. **Export Functionality Prompt:**
"Implement chart export functionality supporting PNG, PDF, and interactive HTML formats. Include batch export options and proper file naming conventions."
```

### Testing & Quality Prompts
```
10. **Testing Framework Prompt:**
