## Copilot Optimization Keywords

### üéØ Essential Keywords to Include
- **Architecture:** "modular", "scalable", "reusable", "extensible"
- **Code Quality:** "clean code principles", "best practices", "well-documented"
- **Technical:** "type annotations", "error handling", "separation of concerns"
- **Modern Patterns:** "state-of-the-art", "modern architectural", "follows standards"

### üí° Prompting Best Practices
1. **Be Technology-Specific:** Always mention exact libraries (pandas, plotly, streamlit)
2. **Request Structure:** Ask for modular, reusable components
3. **Emphasize Quality:** Include "clean code", "best practices", "well-documented"
4. **Think Scalability:** Use "scalable", "extensible", "maintainable"
5. **Request Examples:** Ask for docstrings, type annotations, usage examples

## Sample Enhanced Prompt Usage

### Before (Generic):
```
"Create a function to load CSV data"
```

### After (Copilot-Optimized):
```
"Create a modular, reusable function to load Finnish happiness CSV data using pandas, following clean code principles with comprehensive error handling, type annotations, and well-documented docstrings. Structure the code for easy extension to additional data sources and include data validation that follows state-of-the-art practices."
```

## Integration with Existing Phases

Each phase prompt should be enhanced with these keywords:

- **Phase 1:** Add "modular data loading", "scalable architecture", "clean error handling"
- **Phase 2:** Include "statistical best practices", "extensible analysis framework"  
- **Phase 3:** Emphasize "reusable visualization components", "modern UI patterns"
- **Phase 4:** Focus on "comprehensive testing", "production-ready quality"

This enhanced approach will generate significantly better code from Copilot while maintaining the comprehensive structure of our existing implementation plan.
