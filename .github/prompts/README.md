#### 🔗 Phase 1.2: API Integration  
**File:** `phase-1-2-api-integration.md`
**Focus:** External API integration with Statistics Finland
**Key Outputs:** APIClient class, cached external data, unified data model

### Phase 2: Analysis Engine (Prompts 3-4)
**Objective:** Statistical analysis and hypothesis generation

#### 🔗 Phase 2.1: Statistical Analysis
**File:** `phase-2-1-statistical-analysis.md`
**Focus:** Correlation analysis, country comparisons, factor ranking
**Key Outputs:** HappinessAnalyzer class, correlation matrices, comparative analysis

#### 🔗 Phase 2.2: Hypothesis Generation
**File:** `phase-2-2-hypothesis-generation.md`
**Focus:** Convert statistics into actionable insights
**Key Outputs:** InsightGenerator class, data-driven hypotheses, executive summary

### Phase 3: Visualization & Interface (Prompts 5-6)
**Objective:** Interactive dashboard and compelling visualizations

#### 🔗 Phase 3.1: Core Visualizations
**File:** `phase-3-1-visualizations.md`
**Focus:** Interactive charts highlighting Finland's position
**Key Outputs:** HappinessVisualizer class, correlation heatmaps, comparison charts

#### 🔗 Phase 3.2: Dashboard Development
**File:** `phase-3-2-dashboard.md`
**Focus:** Web interface integrating all analysis and visualizations
**Key Outputs:** Streamlit dashboard, navigation system, export functionality

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance (Prompt 7)
**Objective:** Testing, documentation, and final validation

#### 🔗 Phase 4: Testing & Validation
**File:** `phase-4-testing-validation.md`
**Focus:** Comprehensive testing, documentation, and ministry approval
**Key Outputs:** Test suite, documentation package, production-ready application

## Using These Prompts Effectively

### 🎯 For GitHub Copilot Chat (Enhanced)
1. **Use Enhanced Prompts:** Start with `enhanced-copilot-prompts.md` for Copilot-optimized versions
2. **Include Magic Keywords:** Always use "modular", "scalable", "clean code principles", "type annotations"
3. **Be Technology-Specific:** Mention exact libraries (pandas, plotly, streamlit, pytest)
4. **Request Documentation:** Ask for "comprehensive docstrings", "usage examples", "type annotations"
5. **Follow-up Strategically:** Request code reviews using architectural improvement language

### 🏗️ For Workshop Sessions
1. **Follow Workshop Guide:** Use `workshop-guide.md` for structured 7-session approach
2. **Session-Based Learning:** Each session builds Copilot skills while delivering functionality
3. **Practice Enhanced Prompting:** Learn effective keyword usage and architectural thinking
4. **Validate Learning:** Check against session success criteria before proceeding

### 👥 For Team Collaboration
1. **Shared Vocabulary:** Use enhanced prompts to establish consistent code quality expectations
2. **Code Review Standards:** Apply acceptance criteria during peer reviews
3. **Progressive Enhancement:** Start with basic prompts, evolve to enhanced versions
4. **Knowledge Sharing:** Document effective prompt patterns discovered during development

## Key Success Factors

### Technical Excellence
- Follow the implementation requirements exactly
- Validate all statistical calculations
- Ensure comprehensive error handling
- Maintain clean, documented code

### User-Centric Design
- Keep Ministry of Mirth and Merriment needs central
- Make Finland prominently visible in all visualizations
- Ensure insights are actionable and evidence-based
- Design for non-technical stakeholders

### Quality Assurance
- Test each component before moving to next phase
- Validate against acceptance criteria continuously
- Document everything for future maintenance
- Get stakeholder feedback early and often

## Adaptation Guidelines

### Technology Substitutions
- **Python → R:** Adapt data processing syntax and libraries
- **Streamlit → Dash:** Modify dashboard structure and callbacks
- **Plotly → Matplotlib:** Adjust visualization code and interactivity

### Data Source Changes
- **Statistics Finland → OECD:** Modify API integration approach
- **Additional CSVs:** Extend DataLoader class methods
- **Real-time Data:** Add streaming data processing capabilities

### Scope Modifications
- **Additional Countries:** Extend comparison logic and visualizations
- **More Factors:** Scale analysis engine and visualization capacity
- **Historical Analysis:** Enhance time series analysis capabilities

## Quality Checkpoints

### After Each Phase
- [ ] All acceptance criteria for phase met
- [ ] Code reviewed and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholder feedback incorporated

### Before Final Delivery
- [ ] All phases complete and integrated
- [ ] Comprehensive testing passed
- [ ] Ministry stakeholders approve
- [ ] Deployment instructions validated

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **API Rate Limits:** Implement exponential backoff and caching
2. **Data Quality Problems:** Enhance validation and cleaning logic
3. **Performance Issues:** Optimize data processing and add caching
4. **Visualization Complexity:** Simplify and focus on key insights

### Getting Help
1. Reference the detailed implementation plan for context
2. Check acceptance criteria for specific requirements
3. Review similar implementations in the codebase
4. Ask Copilot for specific troubleshooting help

## Next Steps
1. **Start with Phase 1.1:** Begin with data loading prompt
2. **Work Systematically:** Complete each phase before moving forward
3. **Validate Continuously:** Check against acceptance criteria regularly
4. **Adapt as Needed:** Modify prompts based on specific implementation needs

This prompt library is designed to guide you through building a comprehensive, professional-quality application that meets all the Ministry's needs while providing actionable insights about Finnish happiness factors.
