    def correlation_heatmap(self, factors=None, show_significance=True):
        """Interactive correlation heatmap with p-value annotations"""
        pass
        
    def country_comparison_radar(self, countries=['Finland', 'Denmark', 'Sweden']):
        """Multi-dimensional radar chart comparing countries"""
        pass
        
    def happiness_ranking_bar(self, top_n=20, highlight_nordics=True):
        """Bar chart showing happiness rankings with Finland highlighted"""
        pass
        
    def temporal_trends(self, factors, years_range=(2010, 2024)):
        """Time series visualization of happiness factors"""
        pass
        
    def export_chart(self, fig, filename, formats=['png', 'html']):
        """Export charts in multiple formats"""
        pass
```
