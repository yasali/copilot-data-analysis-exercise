## Copilot Best Practices Discovered

### üèÜ Most Effective Prompt Patterns
1. **Technology + Architecture + Quality:** "Create [specific tech] [architectural pattern] following [quality standard]"
2. **Modular + Extensible:** Always request modular, reusable, extensible designs
3. **Documentation + Examples:** Ask for docstrings, type annotations, and usage examples
4. **Error Handling + Validation:** Request comprehensive error handling and data validation

### üéØ Magic Keywords for Better Results
- **Architecture:** modular, scalable, reusable, extensible, maintainable
- **Quality:** clean code principles, best practices, state-of-the-art, well-documented
- **Technical:** type annotations, error handling, comprehensive, production-ready
- **Patterns:** separation of concerns, configuration-driven, performance-optimized

### üö´ What to Avoid
- Vague requests: "Create a function" ‚Üí "Create a modular function with error handling"
- Missing context: Always provide the Finnish happiness analysis context
- No quality requirements: Always include "clean code principles" or "best practices"
- Single-purpose thinking: Request extensible, reusable solutions
