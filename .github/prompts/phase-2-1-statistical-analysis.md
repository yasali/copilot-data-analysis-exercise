# Phase 2.1: Statistical Analysis Engine

## Context
With data infrastructure complete, now build the core analysis engine to identify correlations and patterns that explain Finland's happiness ranking.

## Objective
Create comprehensive statistical analysis capabilities to uncover relationships between happiness scores and various societal, economic, and cultural factors.

## Analysis Requirements
1. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Pearson and Spearman correlations with significance testing
   - Partial correlations controlling for confounding variables
   - Time-lagged correlations for food consumption trends

2. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Finland vs Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland)
   - Finland vs global happiness leaders
   - Ranking analysis across multiple dimensions

3. **Trend Analysis**
   - Time series analysis for available longitudinal data
   - Change point detection in happiness/factor relationships
   - Seasonal patterns if applicable

## Key Factors to Analyze
- **Economic:** GDP per capita, income inequality, unemployment
- **Social:** Social support, freedom, generosity, corruption perceptions
- **Health:** Life expectancy, healthcare access
- **Cultural:** Food consumption patterns, education levels
- **Environmental:** Climate factors if data available

## Statistical Methods
- Correlation matrices with p-value corrections (Bonferroni)
- Multiple regression analysis for factor importance
- Principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for robust statistics

## Expected Outputs
- AnalysisEngine class with comprehensive statistical methods
- Correlation matrices with significance levels
- Factor importance rankings specific to Finland
- Comparative analysis results (Finland vs other countries)
- Statistical summary reports with confidence intervals
- Automated insight generation based on strongest correlations

## Implementation Requirements
```python
# Example structure
class HappinessAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, data_loader):
        self.data = data_loader
        
    def correlation_analysis(self, method='pearson', significance_level=0.05):
        """Perform correlation analysis with significance testing"""
        pass
        
    def compare_countries(self, reference_country='Finland', comparison_countries=None):
        """Compare Finland against other countries"""
        pass
        
    def factor_importance(self, target='happiness_score'):
        """Rank factors by their association with happiness"""
        pass
        
    def temporal_analysis(self, factors, years_available):
        """Analyze trends over time"""
        pass
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Identifies top 10 factors most correlated with Finland's happiness
- [ ] Provides statistical significance for all correlations (p-values)
- [ ] Compares Finland meaningfully against 5+ other countries
- [ ] Generates at least 5 data-driven hypotheses about Finnish happiness
- [ ] Handles missing data appropriately in all analyses
- [ ] Results are reproducible with consistent random seeds

## Insight Generation Requirements
- Automatically identify strongest positive/negative correlations
- Generate natural language explanations of statistical findings
- Highlight unique aspects of Finland compared to other countries
- Suggest potential causal relationships (with appropriate caveats)
- Create executive summary of key findings

## Quality Assurance
- Validate statistical assumptions before applying tests
- Use appropriate multiple comparison corrections
- Provide confidence intervals for all estimates
- Include effect size measures alongside p-values
- Cross-validate findings using different statistical approaches

Please implement with focus on statistical rigor and interpretable results.
