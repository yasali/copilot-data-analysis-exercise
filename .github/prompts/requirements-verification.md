## Hackathon Timeline Considerations

### ⏱️ Realistic Time Allocation
1. **Data Setup & Loading (1-2 hours)**
   - Load CSV files with validation
   - Set up API integration
   - Implement caching

2. **Initial Analysis (2-3 hours)**
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Calculate correlations
   - Generate insights

3. **Visualization (2-3 hours)**
   - Create charts and graphs
   - Build dashboard/interface
   - Polish presentation

4. **Final Polish & Testing (1-2 hours)**
   - Validation and bug fixes
   - Presentation preparation
   - Documentation

**Total Estimated Time:** 6-10 hours for complete implementation

## Potential Gaps & Mitigation

### Gap 1: Data Mismatch
**Issue:** EdibleFoods data ends in 2011, WHR starts 2005+
**Mitigation:** Focus analysis on overlapping years (2005-2011) or aggregate historical trends

### Gap 2: Statistics Finland API Learning Curve
**Issue:** PxWeb API is complex and unfamiliar
**Mitigation:** Start with pre-loaded data; use API as enhancement (not required)

### Gap 3: Too Many Analysis Options
**Issue:** Paralysis from choosing which factors to analyze
**Mitigation:** Start with pre-suggested factors from WHR (GDP, social support, life expectancy)

### Gap 4: Time Management
**Issue:** Analysis can become too deep if not careful
**Mitigation:** Follow MVP approach - start with basic correlations, add sophistication if time permits

✅ Load WHR2024.csv and EdibleFoods data
✅ Identify 5+ correlations with happiness
✅ Create 3+ visualizations showing Finland's position
✅ Present findings in dashboard or report format
